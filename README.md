## Summary
_A Day at the Beach_ is the culmination of a research project that I did during my Interactive Media Arts graduate studies at NYU. The initial intention of this project was to do a deep dive into sunscreen. I was expecting to learn that sunscreen is a modern invention that is empirically beneficial, and that everyone should wear it. As I conducted my research I discovered that this viewpoint was centered on my own experience as a person with fair skin and a family history of skin cancer. I learned that the history of sunscreen is more nuanced and rich than I had imagined. This project hopes to share a small piece of that rich history through the use of interactive media.
